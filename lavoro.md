#### [Mid o Senior infra/web/dev-ops](#devops) 

##### Datore di Lavoro
"PA" Inglese &middot; [gov.co.uk]

##### Dove
Londra (Holborn)

##### Quando
Prima possibile - ASAP

##### Specifiche
It's a good team, a great client and project and a good day rate. 
Initially the position is for 6 months (good chance it could turn into a 
year), and for anything from 3 to 5 days a week starting as soon as 
possible. 

The core requirements are puppet experience (experience with `chef`, 
`ansible` or other config management should be fine), great **sysadmin** 
skills for all sorts of services, strong **networking**, **scripting** and 
**security** knowledge, and a good sense of humour. The team is growing and 
the client is very reasonable, with a realistic delivery scope, enough 
capacity to deal with tech debt and continuous improvement and good peers. 

The ops and dev teams are both growing and work closely together, 
currently at just over 20 people, about equally split between dev and 
ops. We all do pairing as needed, but not enforced. We work a kanban 
flow and all contribute to the backlog. 


##### Contratto
A contratto

##### Salario
400-500 GBP / giorno
